Audyssey .ady file editor

https://www.avsforum.com/forum/90-receivers-amps-processors/3006886-announcing-ratbuddyssey-tool-tweaking-audyssey-multeq-app-files.html

Preview/early alpha release, for testing functionality of the parameter editing.

Please note that this program is highly unfinished and basic functions such as 'save as' and 'exit' don't work yet.

Exit with the normal Windows 'X' in the corner of the window.

Use 'save' instead of 'save as' - it will save your file as (old filename).modified_by_ratbuddyssey.ady, leaving the original file intact.

You can then upload the new file to your receiver for testing.
